  <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

  <p>Funraise.me! can be considered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giving_circles" title="Giving Circles">giving circle</a>. Users first pool their money into Funraise.me!, users then create petitions that benefit charities of their choice, then funds from the pool will be distributed to these charities when these petitions have been fulfilled.</p>

  <p>When a user donates into Funraise.me!'s pool, s/he will retain a balance in his/her account. When a user "pledges" to a petition, otherwise referred to as a fundraiser, the user promises to donate that amount to the benefiting charity upon completion. Only when the fundraiser is complete will the pledge amount be deducted from his/her account. </p>

  <p>Funraise.me! will then distribute funds, amounts derived from completed fundraisers, to the respective charities.</p>

  <h2 id="funds">Funds, Fees, and Money</h2>

  <h3 id="excess-funds">What happens to funds that have not yet been distributed to charities?</h3>
  <p>Any excess funds, such all users' balances, will be invested in risk-free assets. Any investment income will be used to pay for expenses.</p>

  <h3 id="income">How does Funraise.me! receive income and pay for expenses?</h3>
  <p>Currently, we receive income through the following methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When paying into the donation pool, users are given the option to tip Funraise.me!. All tips are tax deductible.</li>
    <li>These is a $1 fee to create a fundraiser.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="fundraiser-fee">How much does it cost to create a fundraiser?</h3>
  <p>There is a $1 fee to create a fundraiser. We don't intend to ever change the amount of this fee. As well as helping to pay for our expenses, the purpose of this fee is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain a quality of fundraisers.</li>
    <li>Give those who create good fundraisers credit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="transaction-fee">Why does Funraise.me! charge a transaction fee?</h3>
  <p>All fundraising platforms charge fees. However, unlike other platforms, we pass the fees onto our donors, not charities. Thus, if a fundraiser raises $1,000 for a charity, $1,000 will go to that charity upon distribution. Other platforms will take a cut and will not disclose that amount to donors. By passing fees to donors instead of charities, the transference of funds becomes more transparent.</p>
  <p>We also do not charge any additional fees on top of transaction fees except for rounding. In other words, we do not take any administrative cuts. All transaction fees will match our payment processor's fees. Currently, Stripe charges us <strong>2.7% + 30&cent; of</strong> a payment, so we charge <strong>3.0% + 30&cent; on top</strong> of a credit amount to compensate. We will lower the fee when Stripe lower's our fee, so tell Stripe to lower our fee!</p>

  <h3 id="flat-transaction-fee">Why does Funraise.me! charge a flat transaction fee of 30&cent; for each payment?</h3>
  <p>The short answer is that our payment processors charge that amount. However, this should not be a problem due to how Funraise.me! works. Donors should pay one single, large donation and use that donation over a long period of time on several fundraisers. Since fundraisers' may not be completed in a timely manner, pledges may last a long time, and funds may stay in a donor's balance for a long time.</p>
  <p>For example, suppose only 50% of fundraisers are completed within a year. A donor pays $100 into the donation pool and only pledges $5 to a fundraiser at a time. If he pledges to 20 fundraisers, his funds are likely to last two years.</p>

  <h3 id="payment-methods">Can I donate using PayPal, Amazon, etc.?</h3>
  <p>Currently, we only support payments using <a href="https://stripe.com" title="Stripe">Stripe</a>. If you'd like to pay using a different payment processors or can not pay using Stripe, please let us know. We are open to supporting other payment processors. Currently, we only plan on supporting <a href="https://coinbase.com/" title="Coinbase">Coinbase</a>.</p>

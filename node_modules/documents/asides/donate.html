  <h3>How do credits and pledging work?</h3>
  <p>When you have a balance on Funraise.me!, you can use up to your balance to pledge to fundraisers. Only when a fundraiser is completed will your pledged funds actually be deducted from your balance and donated to charity. This allows you to make a pledge to multiple fundraisers, most of which won't be completed anytime soon, with the same $1.</p>

  <h3>How do fees work?</h3>
  <p>Unlike other fundraising platforms, we take all transaction fees from the donors, not the recipient charities. This means that if a fundraiser raised $100,000 for a charity, $100,000 will be distributed to that charity, whereas maybe only $93,000 - $97,000 will actually reach the charity on other fundraising platforms.</p>
  <p>Fees only apply to the credit amount, not the tip. If you're tipping us, we'll pay any associated transaction fees.</p>
  <p>Currently, <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a> charges us <strong>2.7% + 30&cent; of</strong> each transaction, so we charge <strong>3.0% + 30&cent; on top</strong> of each transaction to compensate. </p>

  <h3>How do tips work?</h3>
  <p>99% of the transaction fees go to the payment processors and not us. If our transaction fees are lowered, so will our fees. Instead, we rely on your generous tips to keep Funraise.me! alive. Since Funraise.me! is a charity itself, tips to Funraise.me! are tax-deductible as well.</p>
